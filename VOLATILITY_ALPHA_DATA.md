# Volatility Alpha Validation Data

**Generated**: October 26, 2025  
**Script**: `src/research/volatility_alpha_table.py`

## Summary

Comprehensive volatility alpha analysis across 6 assets and 3 timeframes (1, 2, 3 years).

## Key Findings

### Formula Validation: Alpha ≈ (trigger%)² / 2 × buy_count

**High Volatility Assets** (SD6, 12.25% trigger = 0.75% per cycle):
- **MSTR** (3yr): 66 buys → predicted 49.5% vs **actual 125.11%** (2.5x from gaps!)
- **PLTR** (3yr): 30 buys → predicted 22.5% vs **actual 77.11%** (3.4x from gaps!)
- **ETH-USD** (3yr): 40 buys → predicted 30.0% vs **actual 43.44%** (1.4x from gaps!)
- **NVDA** (3yr): 21 buys → predicted 15.8% vs **actual 33.93%** (2.1x from gaps!)

**Medium Volatility Assets** (SD8, 9.05% trigger = 0.41% per cycle):
- **BTC-USD** (3yr): 34 buys → predicted 13.9% vs **actual 26.28%** (1.9x from gaps!)

**Low Volatility Assets** (SD16, 4.43% trigger = 0.10% per cycle):
- **GLD** (3yr): 12 buys → predicted 1.2% vs **actual 1.36%** (1.1x from gaps)

**Insight**: Higher volatility assets benefit MORE from gaps and asymmetric price movements. Crypto and tech stocks show 2-3x the theoretical minimum!

## Patterns Observed

### Volatility vs Alpha Correlation
- **90%+ volatility** (MSTR): Massive alpha (68-125% over 2-3 years)
- **50-70% volatility** (NVDA, ETH, PLTR): Strong alpha (19-77% over 2-3 years)
- **40% volatility** (BTC): Moderate alpha (11-26% over 2-3 years)
- **<20% volatility** (GLD): Minimal alpha (0.7-1.4% over 1-3 years)

### Time Period Impact
Longer timeframes → MORE volatility alpha (not just proportional):
- **MSTR**: 1yr: 7.6% → 2yr: 68.6% (9x) → 3yr: 125.1% (1.8x)
- **PLTR**: 1yr: 19.1% → 2yr: 43.3% (2.3x) → 3yr: 77.1% (1.8x)
- **NVDA**: 1yr: 5.8% → 2yr: 19.1% (3.3x) → 3yr: 33.9% (1.8x)

This suggests **compounding of volatility cycles** over time!

### Gap Bonus Multiplier by Asset Class
- **Crypto** (MSTR, BTC, ETH): 1.9-2.5x theoretical minimum
- **Tech Growth** (NVDA, PLTR): 2.1-3.4x theoretical minimum
- **Commodities** (GLD): 1.1-1.3x theoretical minimum

Higher volatility → more gaps → more bonus alpha beyond the formula.

## Conclusions

1. **Formula is valid**: Provides reliable conservative lower bound
2. **Gaps matter**: Actual alpha typically 1.5-3x theoretical minimum for volatile assets
3. **Volatility scales alpha**: Higher vol → more cycles AND bigger gaps
4. **Time compounds**: Longer periods show exponential growth in alpha
5. **GLD is the proof**: Low volatility → minimal alpha, matches formula closely

**Investment Implication**: 
- On volatile tech/crypto, even "losing" 1-2 years of compounding to profit-sharing can be offset by volatility alpha
- On stable assets (GLD), focus on dividend income, not volatility alpha
- The formula `alpha ≈ 0.75% × buy_count` (SD6) or `0.41% × buy_count` (SD8) gives you a quick estimate by just counting drawdowns on a chart
