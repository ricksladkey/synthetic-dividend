# Synthetic Dividend Theory Documentation

**Complete theoretical framework** for the Synthetic Dividend Algorithm - a rules-based strategy that converts price volatility into predictable cash flow.

---

## Executive Summary

The Synthetic Dividend Algorithm transforms any volatile asset into a predictable income stream while preserving long-term growth potential. Through systematic rebalancing with strategic buyback mechanisms, it harvests volatility for measurable excess returns (volatility alpha) beyond traditional buy-and-hold strategies.

**Key Innovation**: Four algorithm variants provide different risk/reward profiles:
- **Buy-and-Hold**: Traditional baseline (0% volatility alpha)
- **ATH-Only**: Profit-taking at all-time highs only (path-independent returns)
- **Standard SD**: ATH profit-taking + buybacks during dips (volatility harvesting)
- **ATH-Sell**: Buybacks during dips, but sells only at new all-time highs (maximum compounding)

**Empirical Validation** (Re-validated Oct 31, 2025): 18 scenarios across 6 assets show volatility alpha ranging from 1.1% (GLD) to 198% (PLTR) over 3-year periods with realistic market execution.

## Key Concepts Summary

### The Four Algorithm Variants

| Variant | Buybacks | Sell Triggers | Risk Profile | Best For |
|---------|----------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Buy-and-Hold | ❌ | Never | Lowest | Traditional investors |
| ATH-Only | ❌ | New ATHs only | Low | Conservative profit-taking |
| Standard SD | ✅ | ATHs + brackets | Medium | Balanced growth + income |
| **ATH-Sell** | ✅ | New ATHs only | Medium-High | Maximum compounding |

### Core Mathematical Insights

- **Volatility Alpha Formula**: `α ≥ N × (trigger%)² / 2` (conservative lower bound)
- **Time Machine Effect**: Higher profit sharing → proportionally longer to reach goals
- **Gap Bonus**: Actual alpha exceeds formula by 1.1x-10.6x depending on asset class
- **Coverage Ratio**: Synthetic dividends / withdrawals (>1.0 = self-sustaining)

### Economic Principles

- **Dividend Illusion**: All cash withdrawals have opportunity cost
- **Sequence Protection**: Avoid forced sales during early retirement bear markets
- **Capital Efficiency**: Track deployment metrics, not just share counts
- **Path Independence**: ATH-only strategies guarantee total returns regardless of path
