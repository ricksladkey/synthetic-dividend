## üèÜ Top 10 Experiments to Attack First

These experiments offer the best **insight-to-effort ratio** and build foundational knowledge:

### ü•á #1: Experiment #1 - Gap Frequency Distribution
**Why it's ideal:**
- ‚úÖ **Foundational**: Validates core gap bonus theory with hard data
- ‚úÖ **Easy**: Just analyze existing transaction logs from research_phase1_1year_core.csv
- ‚úÖ **High Impact**: Answers "How often do multi-bracket gaps actually occur?"
- ‚úÖ **Enables Others**: Data feeds into Exp #2, #6, #8, #12

**What we'd learn:**
- Empirical gap distribution by asset (1%, 5%, 10%, 20% gaps)
- Which assets are "gap leaders" (MSTR 234x multiplier - why?)
- Whether gap frequency correlates with volatility (test the hypothesis)

**Estimated effort**: 2 hours (write analysis script, generate charts)

---

### ü•à #2: Experiment #11 - SD Parameter Sweep
**Why it's ideal:**
- ‚úÖ **Practical Value**: Answers "What's the optimal SD for each asset?"
- ‚úÖ **Already 90% done**: We have research_phase1_1year_core.csv with sd4-sd12 data
- ‚úÖ **Visual Impact**: Can generate heat maps showing optimal zones
- ‚úÖ **Validates Gap Bonus Theory**: Does MSTR prefer sd10 or sd12? Why?

**What we'd learn:**
- Optimal SD by asset class (crypto vs tech vs indices)
- Whether gap-adjusted formula (Exp #12) is needed
- Transaction count saturation point (Exp #18)

**Estimated effort**: 3 hours (already have data, need visualization + analysis)

---

### ü•â #3: Experiment #21 - Profit Sharing Sweep (0-100%)
**Why it's ideal:**
- ‚úÖ **User-Facing**: Everyone asks "What profit sharing % should I use?"
- ‚úÖ **Easy to Run**: Batch comparison with 5 values √ó 10 assets = 50 backtests
- ‚úÖ **Frontier Analysis**: Plot cash flow vs total return - beautiful visualization
- ‚úÖ **Surprising Results**: We already know 100% sometimes beats 0% (market timing!)

**What we'd learn:**
- Optimal profit sharing by investment goal (income vs growth)
- Whether high-vol assets benefit from low % (counterintuitive finding?)
- Cash generation vs growth tradeoff quantified

**Estimated effort**: 4 hours (run backtests, create frontier plot, summarize)

---

### #4: Experiment #36 - Safe Withdrawal Rate Discovery
**Why it's ideal:**
- ‚úÖ **Retirement Planning**: The killer use case for synthetic dividends
- ‚úÖ **Quantitative Answer**: Replace "about 4%" with exact numbers by asset
- ‚úÖ **Builds on #21**: Profit sharing √ó withdrawal rate interaction
- ‚úÖ **Real-World Value**: Helps users design portfolios

**What we'd learn:**
- Maximum sustainable withdrawal rate by asset (VOO: 4.5%? NVDA: 6%?)
- Coverage ratio boundaries (when does bank deplete?)
- Which assets are retirement-ready

**Estimated effort**: 5 hours (grid search, coverage analysis, write-up)

---

### #5: Experiment #51 - Asset Class Leaderboard
**Why it's ideal:**
- ‚úÖ **Quick Win**: Rank 12 assets by volatility alpha - one table!
- ‚úÖ **Data exists**: Use research_phase1_1year_core.csv
- ‚úÖ **Marketing Gold**: "Crypto generates 15x more alpha than bonds"
- ‚úÖ **Informs Portfolio Design**: Exp #61-65 need this data

**What we'd learn:**
- Asset class hierarchy (crypto > tech > indices > commodities > bonds?)
- Whether volatility predicts alpha ranking
- Outliers (assets that punch above/below weight)

**Estimated effort**: 1 hour (sort CSV, make table, done!)

---

### #6: Experiment #8 - Transaction Multiplier by Asset Class
**Why it's ideal:**
- ‚úÖ **Gap Bonus Validation**: Directly tests "234x for MSTR" finding
- ‚úÖ **One Metric**: Actual transactions √∑ Theoretical transactions
- ‚úÖ **Asset Class Pattern**: Do all crypto show 100x+? All indices show 2x?
- ‚úÖ **Feeds Theory**: Helps derive gap-adjusted SD formula (Exp #12)

**What we'd learn:**
- Whether multiplier is asset-specific or class-specific
- Predictability of transaction count from volatility alone
- Boundaries (minimum 1x, maximum 300x?)

**Estimated effort**: 2 hours (calculate multipliers, group by class, visualize)

---

### #7: Experiment #37 - Withdrawal Rate Grid (3-6%)
**Why it's ideal:**
- ‚úÖ **Builds on #36**: Comprehensive coverage ratio analysis
- ‚úÖ **Table-Friendly**: 4 rates √ó 10 assets = 40-cell table
- ‚úÖ **Coverage Ratio Zones**: Define "excellent" (>150%), "good" (100-150%), etc.
- ‚úÖ **Practical Guidance**: Helps users choose withdrawal rate

**What we'd learn:**
- Coverage ratio distribution by rate and asset
- Bank depletion thresholds
- Safe vs marginal vs unsustainable zones

**Estimated effort**: 4 hours (grid backtests, heatmap, analysis)

---

### #8: Experiment #54 - 2022 Bear Market Test
**Why it's ideal:**
- ‚úÖ **Stress Test**: Does algorithm protect in -20% market?
- ‚úÖ **Recession Resilience**: Which assets maintain alpha when S&P crashes?
- ‚úÖ **Real Data**: Specific historical period (Jan-Dec 2022)
- ‚úÖ **User Confidence**: "Backtested through bear market" = credibility

**What we'd learn:**
- Whether volatility alpha increases in crashes (hypothesis: yes)
- Which assets are defensive (GLD? BIL?)
- Bank balance behavior during prolonged downturns

**Estimated effort**: 3 hours (run 2022 backtests, compare to 2024 bull market)

---

### #9: Experiment #15 - ATH-Only Comprehensive Baseline
**Why it's ideal:**
- ‚úÖ **Baseline for All**: Every volatility alpha calc needs this
- ‚úÖ **Gap Bonus Isolation**: ATH-only = no buybacks = no gap bonus
- ‚úÖ **Algorithm Variant**: Validates the buyback mechanism's value
- ‚úÖ **Systematic**: 12 assets √ó 6 SD values = 72 baselines

**What we'd learn:**
- ATH-only returns across assets (the "simple" strategy)
- How much alpha buybacks actually add (9.59% for NVDA)
- Whether any assets don't benefit from buybacks (smooth trends?)

**Estimated effort**: 5 hours (batch run, compare to enhanced, document)

---

### #10: Experiment #52 - Correlation Matrix
**Why it's ideal:**
- ‚úÖ **Portfolio Theory**: Foundation for multi-asset portfolios
- ‚úÖ **Uncorrelated Income**: Find assets with opposite income timing
- ‚úÖ **Visual Impact**: Beautiful correlation heatmap
- ‚úÖ **Enables #61-65**: All portfolio experiments need this

**What we'd learn:**
- Which asset pairs have negative income correlation (NVDA/GLD?)
- Whether crypto and equities correlate (probably yes)
- Best diversification pairs for stable income

**Estimated effort**: 4 hours (extract income series, calculate correlations, visualize)

## üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure Gaps Preventing Efficient Research

Looking at the 120 experiments, several **missing infrastructure pieces** make complex questions harder than they should be:

### Gap #1: Batch Experiment Runner
**What's missing:**
```python
# Should be this simple:
runner = ExperimentRunner()
runner.run_grid(
    tickers=['NVDA', 'VOO', 'GLD'],
    strategies=['sd6', 'sd8', 'sd10', 'sd12'],
    profit_sharing=[0, 25, 50, 75, 100],
    start_date='2023-01-01',
    end_date='2024-01-01'
)
# Get: 3 tickers √ó 4 SD √ó 5 profit = 60 backtests automatically
```

**Current state:** Have to run each backtest manually or write custom batch scripts

**Impact:** Experiments #11, #21, #31, #37, #66 all need this

**Implementation:** 
- Create `src/experiments/batch_runner.py`
- Support parameter grids (Cartesian product)
- Parallel execution (utilize all CPU cores)
- Progress tracking and caching

---

### Gap #2: Transaction Log Analysis Tools
**What's missing:**
```python
# Should be able to do:
log = TransactionLog.from_backtest(backtest_result)

# Gap analysis
gaps = log.analyze_gaps()
print(gaps.frequency_by_magnitude())  # 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%
print(gaps.multi_bracket_gaps())       # Count 2+, 3+, 4+ bracket gaps
print(gaps.overnight_vs_intraday())    # Where do gaps come from?

# Income analysis  
income = log.analyze_income()
print(income.monthly_distribution())
print(income.coefficient_of_variation())
```

**Current state:** Transaction data exists in backtest results but not easily queryable

**Impact:** Experiments #1, #3, #6, #14, #29, #42, #86, #87 all need this

**Implementation:**
- Create `src/analysis/transaction_log.py`
- Parse transaction lists into pandas DataFrame
- Add gap detection logic (compare consecutive prices)
- Add income smoothing metrics

---

### Gap #3: Result Aggregation & Comparison Framework
**What's missing:**
```python
# Should be able to do:
results = ExperimentResults.load_many([
    'exp11_nvda_sweep.csv',
    'exp11_voo_sweep.csv', 
    'exp11_gld_sweep.csv'
])

# Compare across dimensions
results.compare_by('ticker', metric='volatility_alpha')
results.compare_by('sd_n', metric='total_return')
results.plot_heatmap(x='ticker', y='sd_n', value='alpha')
results.generate_markdown_report('exp11_summary.md')
```

**Current state:** Manual CSV munging for each comparison

**Impact:** Every experiment needs this for analysis

**Implementation:**
- Create `src/analysis/results.py`
- Unified CSV schema for all experiments
- Comparison utilities (group by, pivot, aggregate)
- Visualization templates (heatmaps, line plots, distributions)

---

### Gap #4: Metric Calculator Suite
**What's missing:**
```python
# Currently missing from backtest.py:
summary = backtest(...)

# Should include:
print(summary['max_drawdown'])          # NOT IMPLEMENTED
print(summary['sharpe_ratio'])           # NOT IMPLEMENTED  
print(summary['sortino_ratio'])          # NOT IMPLEMENTED
print(summary['calmar_ratio'])           # NOT IMPLEMENTED
print(summary['alpha_per_transaction'])  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
print(summary['income_coefficient_of_variation'])  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
```

**Current state:** Only basic metrics (return, alpha, transaction count)

**Impact:** Experiments #28, #96, #97, #98, #99, #14, #29, #87 blocked

**Implementation:**
- Extend `run_algorithm_backtest()` return dict
- Add drawdown tracking to daily loop
- Calculate risk-adjusted metrics
- Add income stability metrics

---

### Gap #5: Portfolio-Level Backtesting
**What's missing:**
```python
# Multi-asset portfolios don't exist yet:
portfolio = Portfolio(
    allocations={
        'NVDA': 0.40,
        'VOO': 0.30,
        'GLD': 0.20,
        'BIL': 0.10
    },
    strategies={
        'NVDA': 'sd8',
        'VOO': 'sd10',
        'GLD': 'sd16',
        'BIL': 'sd20'
    },
    rebalancing='NAV_OPPORTUNISTIC'  # From PORTFOLIO_ABSTRACTION.md
)

results = backtest_portfolio(portfolio, start, end)
```

**Current state:** Only single-asset backtests, manual portfolio construction

**Impact:** Experiments #48, #52, #61-65, #101-105 all blocked

**Implementation:**
- Implement PORTFOLIO_ABSTRACTION.md design
- Create `src/models/portfolio.py`
- Unified bank across assets
- Cross-asset NAV arbitrage
- Rebalancing strategies (Simple, NAV Opportunistic, Target Allocation)

---

### Gap #6: Experiment Template System
**What's missing:**
```bash
# Should be able to bootstrap experiment:
$ ./synthetic-dividend-tool.bat experiment create gap-frequency
# Creates:
#   experiments/exp01_gap_frequency/
#   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run.bat
#   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analyze.py  (template with TODOs)
#   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SUMMARY.md  (template)
#   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/       (empty)

$ cd experiments/exp01_gap_frequency
$ ./run.bat  # Executes experiment
# Outputs:
#   data/gaps.csv
#   results/gap_distribution.png
#   SUMMARY.md (filled in)
```

**Current state:** Every experiment requires manual scaffolding

**Impact:** Slows down ALL experiments, reduces reproducibility

**Implementation:**
- Add `experiment create <name>` to CLI tool
- Template files with standard structure
- Makefile-style dependencies
- Auto-generate SUMMARY.md outline

---

### Gap #7: Time-Series Analysis Tools
**What's missing:**
```python
# For analyzing bank balance, holdings, income over time:
timeseries = TimeSeriesAnalyzer(backtest_result)

# Bank trajectory
timeseries.plot_bank_balance()
timeseries.bank_depletion_events()  # When did bank go negative?
timeseries.bank_growth_rate()       # Trend line

# Holdings trajectory  
timeseries.plot_holdings_count()
timeseries.shares_sold_per_month()

# Income trajectory
timeseries.monthly_income()
timeseries.income_autocorrelation()  # Is income predictable?
```

**Current state:** Summary stats only, no time-series visibility

**Impact:** Experiments #29, #40, #41, #42, #79, #86, #87, #89 need this

**Implementation:**
- Track daily state in backtest (not just summary)
- Create `src/analysis/timeseries.py`
- Plotting utilities for trajectories
- Statistical analysis (trend, autocorrelation, regime detection)

## üí° Strategic Insight: The "Infrastructure Flywheel"

Notice the pattern:
- **Early experiments are hard** (manual data wrangling, custom scripts)
- **Infrastructure emerges** from solving concrete problems
- **Later experiments become trivial** (grid search, one-line queries)

**Example progression:**

```
Exp #1 (Manual):
  - Write custom script: analyze_gaps.py
  - Parse CSV manually
  - 4 hours of work

‚Üì Extract infrastructure ‚Üì

Gap #2: TransactionLog class
  - Reusable gap analysis
  - 30 minutes to add new metric

‚Üì Compounds ‚Üì

Exp #6 (Automated):
  - log.multi_bracket_gaps()
  - 5 minutes of work
```

**Implication:** First 10 experiments will be **80% infrastructure building**, **20% analysis**. But experiments 11-100 flip to **20% infrastructure**, **80% analysis**.

## üöÄ The "Killer App" Experiment

If I had to pick **ONE** experiment that would demonstrate value immediately:

### Experiment #36+37 Combined: "Retirement Feasibility Study"

**The Question:** 
*"Can I retire on $1M using synthetic dividends? What withdrawal rate is safe?"*

**The Output:**
A single comprehensive table:

| Asset | 3% Coverage | 4% Coverage | 5% Coverage | Max Safe Rate | Recommended Strategy |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| VOO   | 185% ‚úÖ | 122% ‚úÖ | 97% ‚ö†Ô∏è  | **4.5%** | sd12, 50% profit |
| NVDA  | 245% ‚úÖ | 184% ‚úÖ | 147% ‚úÖ | **6.2%** | sd8, 50% profit |
| QQQ   | 172% ‚úÖ | 129% ‚úÖ | 103% ‚úÖ | **5.1%** | sd10, 50% profit |
| GLD   | 142% ‚úÖ | 106% ‚úÖ | 85% ‚ùå  | **4.2%** | sd16, 50% profit |
| BTC   | 385% ‚úÖ | 289% ‚úÖ | 231% ‚úÖ | **8.5%** | sd6, 50% profit |

**Why it's the killer app:**
- ‚úÖ Answers THE question every retiree has
- ‚úÖ Quantitative, actionable guidance
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates algorithm's real-world value
- ‚úÖ Differentiates from competitors (no one else has this data)
- ‚úÖ Marketing gold ("Retire with 6% withdrawal on NVDA!")

**Effort:** 6-8 hours (grid search + write-up)

**Impact:** Could drive 100x more user adoption than any other experiment

---

## üìä Summary

**Ideal challenges to attack:**
1. Gap frequency (#1) - foundational data
2. SD parameter sweep (#11) - optimization guidance  
3. Profit sharing sweep (#21) - user-facing decision
4. Safe withdrawal rate (#36+37) - **THE killer app**
5. Asset class leaderboard (#51) - quick marketing win

**Infrastructure needed (priority order):**
1. üî• **Transaction log analyzer** (enables 20+ experiments)
2. üî• **Results aggregation** (needed for every experiment)
3. üî• **Batch runner** (makes grids trivial)
4. **Metric calculator** (adds Sharpe, drawdown, etc.)
5. **Portfolio framework** (unlocks 15+ experiments)
6. Time-series analysis (deep dive tool)
7. Experiment templates (quality of life)

**The flywheel:** Build infrastructure while running first 5 experiments. Subsequent experiments get exponentially easier.

**ROI Recommendation:** Start with Exp #36+37 (retirement feasibility). If it takes 8 hours but produces THE table that sells the algorithm, it's worth 10x more than any other single experiment.
