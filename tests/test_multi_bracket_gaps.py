"""Unit tests for multi-bracket gap handling.

Tests verify that when price gaps by more than one bracket width,
the algorithm correctly processes multiple transactions on the same day.

Example: With 9.05% brackets (sd8):
- Start at $100, sell at $109.05
- If price gaps from $100 to $120 (20% jump = 2.2 brackets)
- Should trigger sells at $109.05 AND $118.92 on the same day
