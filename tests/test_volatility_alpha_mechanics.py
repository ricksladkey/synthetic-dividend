    Test that SD8 generates alpha from a drawdown-and-recovery cycle.

    Price path: $100 -> gradual drawdown to $49 -> gradual recovery to $125
    - 51% drawdown triggers multiple buybacks
    - 155% recovery from bottom generates profit

    Expected behavior:
    - SD8 should execute ~8 buys during drawdown
    - Each buy captures ~0.3% alpha
    - Total alpha should be ~3% (8 buys * 0.3%)
    - Volatility alpha = (SD8 return - Buy&Hold return) should be positive
