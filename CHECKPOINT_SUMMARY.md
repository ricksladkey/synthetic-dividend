## 🎯 Recent Implementations

### 1. Price Normalization ✅
- **Feature**: Deterministic bracket placement
- **Parameter**: `normalize_prices=True`
- **Math**: Scales prices to land on integer brackets (1.0 × (1+r)^n)
- **Benefit**: All backtests using sd8 hit same bracket positions
- **Tests**: 5 comprehensive unit tests
- **Tools**: Order calculator shows bracket ladder

### 2. Withdrawal Policy ✅
- **Feature**: Orthogonal withdrawal dimension
- **Parameters**: `withdrawal_rate_pct`, `withdrawal_frequency_days`, `cpi_adjustment_df`
- **Logic**: Bank-first (sell shares only if needed)
- **Default**: 4% annual, monthly frequency, CPI-adjusted
- **Benefit**: Quantifies value of cash generation
- **Tests**: 3 unit tests validating orthogonality

### 3. Simple Mode ✅
- **Feature**: Clean testing environment
- **Parameter**: `simple_mode=True`
- **Effect**: Disables opportunity cost, risk-free gains, CPI adjustment
- **Benefit**: Deterministic behavior for unit tests
- **Tests**: Validated in withdrawal policy tests

## 🔍 Implementation Verification

### Core Algorithm
```python
# Theory: Volatility alpha = Algorithm return - Baseline return
# Code: src/models/backtest.py:1044
volatility_alpha = total_return - baseline_total_return
```
✅ **VERIFIED**

### Price Normalization
```python
# Theory: n = log(start_price) / log(1 + r), round to integer
# Code: src/models/backtest.py:687
n_float = math.log(start_price) / math.log(1 + rebalance_trigger)
n_int = round(n_float)
```
✅ **VERIFIED**

### Withdrawal Policy
```python
# Theory: Bank-first, sell only if needed
# Code: src/models/backtest.py:844
if bank >= withdrawal_amount:
    bank -= withdrawal_amount  # No forced selling
else:
    # Must sell shares
    shares_to_sell = int((withdrawal_amount - bank) / price) + 1
```
✅ **VERIFIED**

## 💾 Git Status Recommendation

**Suggested commit message**:
```
feat: Add price normalization and withdrawal policy

Major Features:
- Price normalization for deterministic brackets (normalize_prices=True)
- Withdrawal policy as orthogonal dimension (4% rule + CPI adjustment)
- Simple mode for clean testing (simple_mode=True)
- Enhanced order calculator with bracket positions

Tests:
- Added 8 new unit tests (5 normalization + 3 withdrawal)
- All 39 tests passing
- 78% coverage on core engine

Documentation:
- Created PRICE_NORMALIZATION.md
- Created WITHDRAWAL_POLICY.md
- Updated theory/README.md with new docs
- Created CHECKPOINT.md for verification
```

## 📝 Session Notes

**What Worked Well**:
- Orthogonal design for withdrawals
- Test-driven development caught critical bug (withdrawal logic unreachable)
- Price normalization elegantly solves arbitrary bracket problem
- Theory documents kept in sync throughout

**Lessons Learned**:
- Test simple cases first (flat prices, simple data)
- Debug scripts are invaluable for isolating issues
- Orthogonality > special cases
- Document while implementing (not after)

**Technical Debt**: Minimal
- No known bugs
- Theory/practice in sync
- Test coverage appropriate
- Code quality high
