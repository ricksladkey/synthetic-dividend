"""Compare withdrawal scenarios: Cash earning 0% vs VOO returns

Shows the dramatic impact of investing idle cash in VOO instead of
letting it sit at 0% return. The engine already supports this through
the risk_free_data parameter.

Key insight: Cash reserves earning VOO returns can significantly improve
retirement sustainability, especially for strategies like SD8 that build
large cash balances.
