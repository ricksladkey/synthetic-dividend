class SyntheticDividendAlgorithm(AlgorithmBase):
    """Volatility harvesting algorithm that generates synthetic dividends.

    This algorithm exploits mean reversion by systematically buying on dips and
    selling on rises within a symmetrically-spaced bracket system. It operates as
    a volatility-harvesting strategy that generates cash flow ("synthetic dividends")
    from price oscillations.

    PSEUDO-CODE OVERVIEW:
    =====================

    Core Principle: "Treat volatility as a harvestable asset class"

    Given:
        - A volatile growth asset (NVDA, BTC, ETH, etc.)
        - Rebalance trigger 'r' (e.g., 9.15% = one bracket)
        - Profit sharing 's' (e.g., 50% = half position size)

    On Initial Purchase:
        anchor_price ← initial_price
        all_time_high ← initial_price
        buyback_stack ← empty

        Place symmetric limit orders:
            buy_price  ← anchor / (1 + r)      # One bracket below
            sell_price ← anchor × (1 + r)      # One bracket above
            buy_qty    ← holdings × r × s
            sell_qty   ← holdings × r × s / (1 + r)  # Geometric symmetry

    Each Trading Day:
        # Update all-time high
        if today.high > all_time_high:
            all_time_high ← today.high

        # Check if price crossed any brackets (could cross multiple in one day)
        while orders triggered by today's OHLC range:

            if BUY order triggered:
                # Price dropped - buy the dip
                shares_bought ← execute_buy_at(buy_price)
                holdings ← holdings + shares_bought
                buyback_stack.push(shares_bought)

                # Measure volatility alpha (profit from mean reversion)
                profit ← (last_sell_price - buy_price) × shares_bought
                volatility_alpha ← profit / portfolio_value

                # Reset anchor to new transaction price
                anchor_price ← buy_price

            if SELL order triggered:
                # Price rose - take profits
                shares_sold ← execute_sell_at(sell_price)
                holdings ← holdings - shares_sold

                if buyback_enabled:
                    # Track unwinding of buyback stack (diagnostic)
                    buyback_stack.pop(min(shares_sold, stack_size))

                # Reset anchor to new transaction price
                anchor_price ← sell_price

            # Place fresh orders from new anchor point
            cancel_all_old_orders()
            calculate_and_place_new_symmetric_orders(anchor_price)

            # Anti-chatter: new orders can't execute same day
            new_orders.earliest_execution ← tomorrow

    Result: Volatility Alpha
        Each buy-low/sell-high cycle extracts value from price oscillations.
        Formula (theoretical minimum): α ≈ (trigger%)² / 2 × cycle_count
        Reality: Actual alpha is 1.1x to 10.6x this formula due to gaps!

    KEY INSIGHTS FROM THEORY:
    =========================

    1. Dividend Illusion:
       "There's no free money - every withdrawal has opportunity cost"
       → We acknowledge this and measure opportunity cost vs buy-and-hold

    2. Time Machine Effect:
       "Profit sharing creates non-linear time dilation"
       → 50% profit sharing = 2x time to reach goals
       → Trade current income for future growth, or vice versa

    3. Volatility as Asset Class:
       "Traditional finance: volatility = risk to minimize"
       "Our view: volatility = harvestable value"
       → Four sources: price path, drawdown recycling, compounding, gap arbitrage
       → Empirical validation: +1% to +198% alpha over 3 years

    4. Geometric Symmetry:
       "Why divide sell qty by (1 + r)?"
       → Ensures exact price unwinding: buy at P/(1+r), sell at P×(1+r)
       → FIFO stack requires equal dollar amounts, not equal shares
       → Example: Buy 10 shares @ $91, sell 9.2 shares @ $100 → same $910

    5. Multi-Bracket Gaps:
       "Price can jump multiple brackets in one day"
       → Each bracket crossing = separate FIFO stack entry
       → Iterate until no more triggers (max 20 iterations/day)
       → Preserves exact symmetry for profit calculation

    OPERATING MODES:
    ================

    Full Mode (buyback_enabled=True):
        - Places both BUY and SELL orders
        - Maintains buyback stack for tracking
        - Generates volatility alpha from mean reversion
        - Use for: actual income generation

    ATH-Only Mode (buyback_enabled=False):
        - Places only SELL orders at new all-time highs
        - No buyback stack needed
        - Baseline for measuring volatility alpha
        - Use for: performance comparison

    ATH-Sell Mode (sell_at_new_ath=True):
        - Places BUY orders on dips (builds stack)
        - Only SELLS when price exceeds previous ATH
        - Maximizes compounding during recoveries
        - Use for: accumulation phase with minimal selling

    MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
    ========================

    Bracket Spacing (Geometric):
        buy_price  = anchor / (1 + r)
        sell_price = anchor × (1 + r)

    Trade Sizing (Profit Sharing):
        buy_qty  = holdings × r × s
        sell_qty = holdings × r × s / (1 + r)

    Where:
        r = rebalance_size (bracket spacing, e.g., 0.0915 for SD8)
        s = profit_sharing (extraction ratio, e.g., 0.5 for 50%)

    Volatility Alpha Calculation:
        profit = (sell_price - buy_price) × shares_in_cycle
        alpha  = profit / portfolio_value × 100

    Theoretical Minimum (from VOLATILITY_ALPHA_THESIS.md):
        alpha_per_cycle ≈ (r)² / 2
        total_alpha     ≈ cycle_count × (r)² / 2

    Reality Check (from empirical validation):
        GLD (16% vol):  1.1x formula  → predictable
        BTC (40% vol):  1.9x formula  → moderate gaps
        MSTR (90% vol): 2.1x formula  → extreme frequency
        NVDA (52% vol): 5.7x formula  → explosive growth gaps! 🚀
        PLTR (68% vol): 10.6x formula → explosive growth gaps! 🚀

    PARAMETERS:
    ===========
        rebalance_size: Bracket spacing as decimal (e.g., 0.0915 = 9.15% brackets)
        profit_sharing: Trade size as fraction of rebalance (e.g., 0.5 = 50%)
        buyback_enabled: True for full algorithm, False for ATH-only baseline
        sell_at_new_ath: True for ATH-sell variant (only sell at new ATHs)

    EXAMPLES:
    =========

    # Full volatility harvesting (standard)
    algo = SyntheticDividendAlgorithm(
        rebalance_size=0.0915,  # SD8: 9.15% brackets
        profit_sharing=0.5,      # 50% extraction
        buyback_enabled=True
    )

    # ATH-only baseline (for comparison)
    baseline = SyntheticDividendAlgorithm(
        rebalance_size=0.0915,
        profit_sharing=0.5,
        buyback_enabled=False    # Only sells at ATHs
    )

    # ATH-sell variant (accumulation mode)
    accumulator = SyntheticDividendAlgorithm(
        rebalance_size=0.0915,
        profit_sharing=0.5,
        sell_at_new_ath=True     # Only sells at new ATHs
    )

    PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS (from experiments/volatility-alpha-validation/):
    ==========================================================================

    Asset     | Vol  | Algo | Period | Expected Alpha (3yr)
    ----------|------|------|--------|--------------------
    GLD       | 16%  | SD16 | Stable | ~1%   (minimal)
    VOO       | 20%  | SD16 | Stable | ~3%   (low)
    BTC-USD   | 40%  | SD8  | Crypto | ~27%  (moderate)
    ETH-USD   | 54%  | SD6  | Crypto | ~46%  (strong)
    NVDA      | 52%  | SD6  | Growth | ~77%  (explosive!) 🚀
    PLTR      | 68%  | SD6  | Growth | ~198% (extraordinary!) 🚀🚀

    Rule of Thumb:
        - Higher volatility → more cycles → more alpha
        - Explosive growth → large gaps → MASSIVE alpha boost
        - Formula gives conservative minimum, reality often exceeds it
