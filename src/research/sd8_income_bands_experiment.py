SD8 Income Bands Experiment

Demonstrates synthetic dividend (SD8) algorithm cash management with income band visualization.

This experiment shows how the SD8 algorithm actively manages cash positions while maintaining
a 8% target return, and visualizes the portfolio as stacked income bands with withdrawals.

Key findings:
- SD8 algorithm adapts cash position (10-30%) based on market volatility
- Maintains active cash management for withdrawal liquidity
- Shows proper stacking: withdrawals (red) → cash (green) → assets (colored)
- Demonstrates volatility alpha generation through active rebalancing
