    # Day 1: Gap down where price opens LOW and stays there
    # We start at $100, and want to gap down to trigger 2 buy brackets
    # With 9.15% rebalance:
    #   First bracket: $100 / 1.0915 = $91.62
    #   After fill at $91.62, next bracket: $91.62 / 1.0915 = $83.95

    # To trigger exactly 2 brackets: gap to between $83.95 and $91.62
    # Let's use $86 (triggers $91.62 bracket, but not yet the $83.95 bracket on second iteration)
    #
    # Actually, the issue is that if we set High=86, it won't gap enough.
    # We need the gap itself to cross multiple brackets.
    #
    # The real scenario: overnight gap down from $100 to $86
    # In practice, this would show as: previous_close=$100, open=$86, low=$86, high=$86
    # But we're only evaluating one day at a time.
    #
    # Let's think differently: we want to test the ITERATION logic.
    # If open=$86, then the order at $91.62 triggers immediately.
    # After that fill, new orders are placed based on $86.
    # New buy order would be at $86 / 1.0915 = $78.79
