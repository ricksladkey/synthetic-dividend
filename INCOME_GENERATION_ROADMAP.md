# Income Generation Roadmap
## Synthetic Dividends as an Income Strategy

**Created**: October 25, 2025  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Goal**: Position synthetic dividend strategy as a viable income generation approach for growth stock investors

---

## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

Millions of investors hold growth stocks (NVDA, AAPL, TSLA, QQQ, SPY) but need regular income. Current options are unsatisfying:

- **Sell shares ad-hoc**: Psychologically painful, tax-inefficient, no strategy
- **Switch to dividend stocks**: Sacrifice growth potential, limited upside
- **Covered calls**: Complex, time decay, limited volatility capture
- **Do nothing**: Starve while sitting on unrealized gains

### Our Solution

**Systematic profit-taking that converts volatility into cash flow.**

A mathematically rigorous approach to:
1. Take profits automatically using rebalancing triggers
2. Generate cash from market volatility (even during drawdowns)
3. Maintain exposure to long-term growth
4. Create predictable income streams from growth assets

### Early Results (Experiments 001-003)

| Asset | Period | Return Sacrifice | Cash Flow Coverage | Outcome |
|-------|--------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| SPY | 2020-2025 | -1.27% | **497%** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Sweet spot |
| QQQ | 2021-2025 | **+0.09%** | **201%** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Positive alpha |
| NVDA | 2020-2025 | -27% to -32% | 73-110% | ‚ö†Ô∏è High cost |

**Key Insight**: Moderate volatility (SPY/QQQ) creates optimal conditions for income generation with minimal return sacrifice.

- Which experiment is most critical? (Recommend: 30-year sustainability)
- GUI vs CLI for calculator? (Recommend: CLI first, GUI later)

**Resources Needed**:
- Long-term historical data (S&P 500 back to 1990s)
- Dividend data for comparison experiments
- Tax rate tables for efficiency analysis

---

## Open Questions

1. **Optimal trigger for income**: Is 8% actually optimal, or should we test wider range?

2. **Tax-lot accounting**: Do we need full tax-lot tracking for realistic tax analysis?

3. **Profit sharing trade-offs**: How does profit sharing impact income generation vs growth?

4. **Multiple assets**: Should we test diversified portfolios (SPY+QQQ+bonds)?

5. **Dynamic triggers**: Could adaptive triggers improve income consistency?

6. **Minimum income guarantee**: Should we add a "floor" that forces sales if needed?

7. **Maximum transaction limits**: Cap transactions to control costs/taxes?

8. **Integration with existing portfolios**: How to transition from buy-and-hold to SD?
