# Implementation Checkpoint

**Date**: October 25, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ All tests passing (39/39)  
**Coverage**: 26% (focused on critical paths)

## Theory ↔ Practice Verification

This document verifies that theory documents accurately reflect the actual implementation.

### ✅ Core Algorithm (INVESTING_THEORY.md + VOLATILITY_ALPHA_THESIS.md)

**Theory states:**
- Volatility alpha = Algorithm return - Buy-and-hold return
- Alpha is generated through volatility harvesting
- ATH-only vs Full (with buybacks) strategies

**Implementation verified:**
```python
# src/models/backtest.py:1044
volatility_alpha = total_return - baseline_total_return

# Two strategy modes
if self.buyback_enabled:
    # Full mode: buy on dips, sell on rises
else:
    # ATH-only: only sell at new all-time highs
```

**Status**: ✅ **MATCHES** - Theory accurately describes implementation

---

### ✅ Initial Capital Theory (INITIAL_CAPITAL_THEORY.md)

**Theory states:**
- Two separate capital streams: equity position vs trading cash flow
- Opportunity cost calculated on negative bank balance (borrowing)
- Risk-free gains calculated on positive bank balance (cash interest)
- Alpha calculation excludes opportunity cost/gains (unchanged)

**Implementation verified:**
```python
# src/models/backtest.py:967-1001
# Calculate opportunity cost (negative bank = borrowing)
if not simple_mode:
    for d, bank_balance in bank_history:
        if bank_balance < 0:
            opportunity_cost_total += abs(bank_balance) * daily_return
        else:
            risk_free_gains_total += bank_balance * risk_free_daily_return

# Volatility alpha calculated BEFORE applying costs/gains
volatility_alpha = total_return - baseline_total_return  # Line 1044

# Then costs/gains added to summary separately
summary["opportunity_cost"] = opportunity_cost_total
summary["risk_free_gains"] = risk_free_gains_total
```

**Status**: ✅ **MATCHES** - Theory correctly identifies the two-stream model

**Known issue documented in theory**: 
- Initial capital (equity position) not tracked separately from trading cash flow
- Opportunity cost applies to combined stream
- Future enhancement opportunity

---

### ✅ Price Normalization (PRICE_NORMALIZATION.md)

**Theory states:**
- Normalizes prices to standard bracket positions: 1.0 × (1 + r)^n
- Find bracket: n = log(start_price) / log(1 + r)
- Round to nearest integer
- Scale all prices: scale = target_price / start_price

**Implementation verified:**
```python
# src/models/backtest.py:687-715
if normalize_prices:
    # Get rebalance trigger from algorithm
    rebalance_trigger = algo.rebalance_size  # Already in decimal form
    
    if rebalance_trigger > 0:
        # Find which bracket the start_price should be on
        n_float = math.log(start_price) / math.log(1 + rebalance_trigger)
        n_int = round(n_float)  # Round to nearest integer bracket
        
        # Calculate the scale to land exactly on that bracket
        target_price = math.pow(1 + rebalance_trigger, n_int)
        price_scale_factor = target_price / start_price
        
        # Scale all prices in the dataframe
        for col in ['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close']:
            if col in df_indexed.columns:
                df_indexed[col] = df_indexed[col] * price_scale_factor
```

**Status**: ✅ **MATCHES** - Implementation follows theory exactly

**Test validation:**
- 5 unit tests in `tests/test_price_normalization.py`
- Verified deterministic bracket placement
- Confirmed identical relative progressions across different start prices

---

### ✅ Withdrawal Policy (WITHDRAWAL_POLICY.md)

**Theory states:**
- Orthogonal to strategy (applies to all)
- Bank-first approach (sell only if needed)
- Standard 4% rule with CPI adjustment
- Simple mode disables inflation/costs

**Implementation verified:**
```python
# src/models/backtest.py:820-875
# Withdrawal logic ALWAYS runs (outside transaction conditional)
if base_withdrawal_amount > 0:
    days_since_last = (d - last_withdrawal_date).days if last_withdrawal_date else withdrawal_frequency_days
    
    if days_since_last >= withdrawal_frequency_days:
        # Calculate withdrawal (with CPI adjustment if enabled)
        withdrawal_amount = base_withdrawal_amount
        if d in cpi_returns and not simple_mode:
            withdrawal_amount = base_withdrawal_amount * cpi_returns[d]
        
        # Bank-first logic
        if bank >= withdrawal_amount:
            bank -= withdrawal_amount  # Withdraw from cash
        else:
            # Must sell shares
            cash_needed = withdrawal_amount - bank
            shares_to_sell = int(cash_needed / price) + 1
            holdings -= shares_to_sell
            shares_sold_for_withdrawals += shares_to_sell
            bank = 0.0
        
        total_withdrawn += withdrawal_amount
        withdrawal_count += 1
```

**Status**: ✅ **MATCHES** - Theory accurately describes orthogonal design

**Critical bug fix documented:**
- Initial implementation had withdrawal logic inside `if tx is not None:` block
- Buy-and-hold returned `None` → skipped withdrawals
- Fixed by moving withdrawal logic outside conditional
- Validated with debug script and unit tests

---

### ✅ Return Metrics (RETURN_METRICS_ANALYSIS.md)

**Theory states:**
- Primary metrics: total_return, annualized, volatility_alpha
- Supplementary: bank stats, opportunity cost, risk-free gains
- Capital utilization tracking
- "More shares ≠ success" fallacy prevention

**Implementation verified:**
```python
# src/models/backtest.py:987-1010
summary = {
    # Core position
    "holdings": holdings,
    "bank": bank,
    "end_value": end_value,
    "total": total,
    
    # Bank statistics
    "bank_min": bank_min,
    "bank_max": bank_max,
    "bank_avg": bank_avg,
    "negative_bank_count": negative_bank_count,
    "positive_bank_count": positive_bank_count,
    
    # Costs and gains
    "opportunity_cost": opportunity_cost_total,
    "risk_free_gains": risk_free_gains_total,
    
    # Primary metrics
    "total_return": total_return,
    "annualized": annualized,
    
    # Capital utilization
    "avg_deployed_capital": avg_deployed_capital,
    "capital_utilization": capital_utilization,
}
```

**Status**: ✅ **MATCHES** - Metrics tracked as documented

---

### ✅ Coding Philosophy (CODING_PHILOSOPHY.md)

**Theory states:**
- Test-Driven Trust: tests validate economic behavior
- Code as documentation
- Fail-fast with clear error messages
- Empirical validation over theory

**Implementation verified:**

**Test Suite**: 39 tests across 5 files
- `test_buyback_stack.py` - 11 tests (economic behavior)
- `test_synthetic_dividend.py` - 8 tests (symmetry properties)
- `test_volatility_alpha_synthetic.py` - 12 tests (alpha generation)
- `test_withdrawal_policy.py` - 3 tests (orthogonal design)
- `test_price_normalization.py` - 5 tests (deterministic brackets)

**Code clarity example:**
```python
# Descriptive function names
def calculate_synthetic_dividend_orders(...)
def run_algorithm_backtest(...)

# Clear parameter names
withdrawal_rate_pct: float = 0.0  # Not just "rate"
normalize_prices: bool = False    # Not just "normalize"

# Comprehensive docstrings
"""Execute backtest of trading algorithm against historical price data.

Flow:
1. Initial BUY of initial_qty shares on first trading day ≥ start_date
2. Each day: call algo.on_day() which may return Transaction or None
...
"""
```

**Status**: ✅ **MATCHES** - Philosophy evident in implementation
