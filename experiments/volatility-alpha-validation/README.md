# Volatility Alpha Validation Data

**Location**: `experiments/volatility-alpha-validation/`
**Generated**: October 31, 2025 (Re-validated after algorithm fixes)
**Original**: October 26, 2025 (Pre-fix data archived as `volatility_alpha_table_OLD.csv`)
**Script**: `src/research/volatility_alpha_table.py`

## IMPORTANT: Data Re-validation

This data was **re-generated on October 31, 2025** after critical algorithm fixes:
1. **Realistic market execution**: Gap-through orders now fill at actual open price (not theoretical limit price)
2. **Anti-chatter fix**: Orders placed on day D execute on D+1 (prevents same-day trading)

The original data (Oct 26) was collected BEFORE these fixes. See [COMPARISON_OLD_VS_NEW.md](COMPARISON_OLD_VS_NEW.md) for detailed analysis of how the fixes affected results.

## How to Reproduce

### Quick Method (Windows)
```bash
cd experiments/volatility-alpha-validation
generate-data.bat
```

### Manual Method (Any Platform)
```bash
# From repository root
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m src.research.volatility_alpha_table

# Output: volatility_alpha_table.csv
```

The script will:
1. Fetch historical data for 6 assets (NVDA, MSTR, BTC-USD, ETH-USD, PLTR, GLD)
2. Calculate annualized volatility for each asset
3. Auto-suggest optimal SD parameter based on volatility
4. Run backtests for 1, 2, and 3 year periods ending Oct 26, 2025
5. Compare full strategy (with buybacks) vs ATH-only
6. Generate CSV with all metrics

**Runtime**: ~2-3 minutes (fetches data from Yahoo Finance)

## Summary

Comprehensive volatility alpha analysis across 6 assets and 3 timeframes (1, 2, 3 years).

## Key Findings

### Formula Validation: Alpha ≈ (trigger%)² / 2 × buy_count

**High Volatility Assets** (SD6, 12.25% trigger = 0.75% per cycle):
- **PLTR** (3yr): 25 buys → predicted 18.75% vs **actual 198.40%** (10.6x from gaps!)
- **MSTR** (3yr): 68 buys → predicted 51.0% vs **actual 109.37%** (2.1x from gaps!)
- **NVDA** (3yr): 18 buys → predicted 13.5% vs **actual 76.78%** (5.7x from gaps!)
- **ETH-USD** (3yr): 39 buys → predicted 29.25% vs **actual 45.94%** (1.6x from gaps!)

**Medium Volatility Assets** (SD8, 9.05% trigger = 0.41% per cycle):
- **BTC-USD** (3yr): 34 buys → predicted 13.9% vs **actual 27.11%** (1.9x from gaps!)

**Low Volatility Assets** (SD16, 4.43% trigger = 0.10% per cycle):
- **GLD** (3yr): 10 buys → predicted 1.0% vs **actual 1.06%** (1.1x from gaps)

**Insight**: Explosive growth stocks (PLTR, NVDA) with realistic gap-fill execution show 5-10x theoretical minimum! Crypto and MSTR show 2x. GLD remains close to formula prediction.

## Patterns Observed

### Volatility vs Alpha Correlation
- **90%+ volatility** (MSTR): Massive alpha (70-109% over 2-3 years)
- **50-70% volatility** (NVDA, ETH, PLTR): Strong alpha (20-198% over 2-3 years)
- **40% volatility** (BTC): Moderate alpha (12-27% over 2-3 years)
- **<20% volatility** (GLD): Minimal alpha (0.2-1.1% over 1-3 years)

### Time Period Impact
Longer timeframes → MORE volatility alpha (not just proportional):
- **PLTR**: 1yr: 16.4% → 2yr: 58.2% (3.6x) → 3yr: 198.4% (3.4x)
- **MSTR**: 1yr: 6.9% → 2yr: 69.7% (10.1x) → 3yr: 109.4% (1.6x)
- **NVDA**: 1yr: 5.4% → 2yr: 19.6% (3.6x) → 3yr: 76.8% (3.9x)

This suggests **compounding of volatility cycles** over time!

### Gap Bonus Multiplier by Asset Class (Realistic Execution)
- **Explosive Tech Growth** (PLTR, NVDA): 5.7-10.6x theoretical minimum
- **Crypto/Volatile** (MSTR, BTC, ETH): 1.6-2.1x theoretical minimum
- **Commodities** (GLD): 1.1x theoretical minimum

**Key Insight**: Realistic gap-fill execution dramatically benefits stocks with explosive growth phases and large gaps. The algorithm captures the full gap-up on rebalancing buy orders.

## Conclusions

1. **Formula is valid as lower bound**: Provides reliable conservative minimum estimate
2. **Realistic execution amplifies gaps**: Explosive growth stocks (PLTR, NVDA) show 5-10x theoretical minimum
3. **Volatility scales alpha**: Higher vol → more cycles AND bigger gaps
4. **Time compounds**: Longer periods show exponential growth in alpha
5. **GLD confirms formula**: Low volatility → minimal alpha, matches formula closely at 1.1x
6. **PLTR is extraordinary**: 198.40% volatility alpha over 3 years - nearly doubling returns through dip-buying alone

**Investment Implication**:
- On explosive growth stocks (PLTR, NVDA), volatility alpha can EXCEED the base return contribution
- On volatile crypto/MSTR, expect 2x theoretical minimum (still substantial)
- On stable assets (GLD), focus on dividend income, not volatility alpha
- The formula `alpha ≈ 0.75% × buy_count` (SD6) or `0.41% × buy_count` (SD8) gives you a conservative lower bound
- Realistic execution means actual alpha is typically 2-10x this minimum for volatile growth stocks
