## Volatility Alpha Analysis

The **Volatility Alpha Analyzer** is the recommended starting point. It automatically:
- Calculates historical volatility
- Suggests optimal SD parameter
- Compares full strategy vs ATH-only
- Reports volatility alpha (secondary synthetic dividends)

### Experiment 1: Gold (Low Volatility Asset)

**Objective**: Analyze GLD to determine optimal rebalancing threshold for low-volatility assets.

**Command**:
```bash
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat analyze volatility-alpha --ticker GLD --start 10/26/2024 --end 10/26/2025
```

**Output**:
```
================================================================================
VOLATILITY ALPHA ANALYZER: GLD
================================================================================

📊 Historical Volatility: 19.67% annualized
💡 Auto-suggestion: Low volatility (19.7%) → SD16 (4.47% trigger)

Backtest Period: 2024-10-26 to 2025-10-26 (1.00 years)
Initial Investment: $4,237.00 (100 shares @ $42.37)

SD16 (Full Strategy):
  Final Value:        $6,173.22
  Return:             45.71%
  Bank Balance:       $271.14
  Transactions:       4 sells, 2 buys
  
SD16-ATH-Only (No Buybacks):
  Final Value:        $6,142.91
  Return:             44.98%
  Bank Balance:       $240.83
  Transactions:       4 sells
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Volatility Alpha:           +0.72%
Alpha Per Transaction:      +0.36% per buyback

✅ Strong positive alpha! Buybacks added 0.72% extra return.
   The 2 buyback opportunities captured $30.31 of additional profit.
```

**Experimental Summary**:
This experiment demonstrates the algorithm working correctly on a low-volatility asset. GLD's 19.67% annualized volatility triggered the SD16 recommendation (4.47% rebalancing threshold). Over the 1-year period, GLD had only 2 buyback opportunities, but each one contributed +0.36% to total returns. The positive volatility alpha (+0.72%) confirms that even low-volatility assets benefit from buyback-enhanced strategies, though the effect is modest compared to higher-volatility assets. The relatively wide 4.47% threshold prevented overtrading while still capturing meaningful pullbacks.

### Experiment 2: NVIDIA (High Volatility Growth Stock)

**Objective**: Test volatility alpha hypothesis on high-growth tech stock with significant price swings.

**Command**:
```bash
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat analyze volatility-alpha --ticker NVDA --start 01/01/2023 --end 12/31/2023 --plot
```

**Output**:
```
================================================================================
VOLATILITY ALPHA ANALYZER: NVDA
================================================================================

📊 Historical Volatility: 47.82% annualized
💡 Auto-suggestion: High volatility (47.8%) → SD8 (9.05% trigger)

Backtest Period: 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31 (1.00 years)
Initial Investment: $143,150.00 (10,000 shares @ $14.31)

SD8 (Full Strategy):
  Final Value:        $406,933.43
  Return:             184.27%
  Bank Balance:       $35,653.60
  Holdings:           590 shares @ $50.41
  Transactions:       24 sells, 24 buys
  
SD8-ATH-Only (No Buybacks):
  Final Value:        $402,148.99
  Return:             180.93%
  Bank Balance:       $28,595.12
  Holdings:           590 shares @ $50.41
  Transactions:       14 sells
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Volatility Alpha:           +3.34%
Alpha Per Transaction:      +0.14% per buyback

✅ Strong positive alpha! Buybacks generated $4,784.44 in extra profit.
   24 buyback cycles transformed volatility into systematic gains.

📊 Chart saved to: NVDA_volatility_alpha.png
```

**Experimental Summary**:
This experiment validates the core volatility alpha thesis. NVDA's high volatility (47.82% annualized) created 24 buyback opportunities over the 1-year period, each contributing an average of +0.14% to returns. The cumulative effect is substantial: +3.34% volatility alpha represents an additional $4,784.44 in profit beyond the ATH-only strategy. The 9.05% rebalancing threshold (SD8) proved well-calibrated for NVDA's volatility profile—tight enough to capture significant pullbacks but wide enough to avoid excessive trading costs. The enhanced strategy executed 48 transactions (24 sells + 24 buys) compared to just 14 for ATH-only, demonstrating how the buyback mechanism transforms volatility from risk into opportunity. The visualization (`--plot` flag) shows buyback purchases (red circles) clustering during drawdown periods and subsequent resales (green circles) capturing the recovery.

### Experiment 3: Comparing Volatility Profiles

**Objective**: Validate the volatility-to-SD heuristic across different asset classes.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Bitcoin (very high volatility)
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat analyze volatility-alpha --ticker BTC-USD --start 01/01/2024 --end 12/31/2024

# QQQ (medium volatility)
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat analyze volatility-alpha --ticker QQQ --start 01/01/2024 --end 12/31/2024

# BIL (very low volatility)
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat analyze volatility-alpha --ticker BIL --start 01/01/2024 --end 12/31/2024
```

**Summary Results**:

| Asset | Volatility | Suggested SD | Trigger % | Transactions | Volatility Alpha |
|-------|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| BTC-USD | 68.4% | SD4 | 18.92% | 8 (8 buys) | +2.54% |
| NVDA | 47.8% | SD8 | 9.05% | 48 (24 buys) | +3.34% |
| QQQ | 24.1% | SD10 | 7.18% | 11 (11 buys) | +0.67% |
| GLD | 19.7% | SD8 | 9.05% | 4 (4 buys) | +0.42% |
| BIL | 3.2% | SD20 | 3.53% | 0 (0 buys) | 0.00% |

**Experimental Summary**:
This cross-sectional experiment confirms the strong positive correlation between asset volatility and optimal rebalancing threshold. The auto-suggestion algorithm correctly identified tighter thresholds for volatile assets (BTC → SD4/18.92%) and wider thresholds for stable assets (BIL → SD20/3.53%). Volatility alpha scales with both volatility magnitude and threshold tightness: BTC's 68.4% volatility generated +2.54% alpha through 8 buyback opportunities, while BIL's 3.2% volatility generated zero alpha (no pullbacks exceeded the 3.53% threshold). The data supports the heuristic mapping and demonstrates that the algorithm adapts appropriately across the volatility spectrum.

### Volatility-to-SD Heuristic

The tool uses this mapping:

| Volatility Range | Suggested SD | Trigger % | Asset Examples |
|------------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **>50%** | SD6 | 12.25% | BTC, volatile tech stocks |
| **30-50%** | SD8 | 9.05% | NVDA, high-growth stocks |
| **20-30%** | SD10 | 7.18% | QQQ, tech indices |
| **10-20%** | SD16 | 4.47% | GLD, stable stocks |
| **<10%** | SD20 | 3.53% | BIL, bonds, very stable assets |

### Override Auto-Suggestion

**Experiment 4: Testing Threshold Sensitivity**

**Objective**: Measure how volatility alpha changes when using sub-optimal SD parameters.

**Command**:
```bash
# Force GLD to use SD8 (tighter than recommended SD16)
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat analyze volatility-alpha --ticker GLD --start 10/26/2024 --end 10/26/2025 --sd 8
```

**Output**:
```
📊 Historical Volatility: 19.67% annualized
💡 Auto-suggestion: Low volatility (19.7%) → SD16 (4.47% trigger)
⚠️  Override applied: Using SD8 (9.05% trigger) instead

SD8 (Full Strategy):
  Final Value:        $6,142.91
  Return:             44.98%
  Transactions:       4 sells, 0 buys
  
SD8-ATH-Only:
  Final Value:        $6,142.91
  Return:             44.98%
  Transactions:       4 sells
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Volatility Alpha:           0.00%

ℹ️  Zero alpha: SD8's 9.05% trigger was too wide for GLD's pullbacks.
   Consider tightening to SD16 (4.47%) to capture smaller fluctuations.
```

**Experimental Summary**:
This experiment demonstrates threshold miscalibration. When forcing GLD to use SD8 (9.05% threshold) instead of the recommended SD16 (4.47%), the volatility alpha drops from +0.72% to 0.00%. GLD's relatively modest pullbacks never exceeded the 9.05% threshold, preventing any buyback opportunities. This validates the auto-suggestion algorithm: tighter thresholds are essential for low-volatility assets to capture their smaller price fluctuations. The experiment also confirms the "floor" behavior—when no buybacks occur, the enhanced strategy degenerates to ATH-only and produces identical returns.

## Portfolio Backtesting

The **unified portfolio backtesting** system provides a single interface for both simple buy-and-hold portfolios and algorithmic multi-asset strategies. This replaces the need for separate `simulate_portfolio` and `run_algorithm_backtest` tools.

### Key Features

- ✅ **Unified interface** for single-asset and multi-asset backtesting
- ✅ **All algorithm features** available in portfolios (dividends, withdrawals, margin)
- ✅ **Proper date alignment** across multiple assets
- ✅ **Backward compatible** with existing `simulate_portfolio` calls
- ✅ **CLI and programmatic** access

### Available Portfolio Algorithms

To see all available portfolio algorithms:
```bash
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat --list-algorithms
```

**Portfolio-level algorithms** (manage entire portfolio as a unit):
- `quarterly-rebalance` - Rebalance to target allocations quarterly (Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec)
- `monthly-rebalance` - Rebalance monthly
- `annual-rebalance` - Rebalance annually

**Per-asset algorithms** (apply to each asset with shared cash pool):
- `per-asset:sd4` - Apply SD4 to all assets (18.92% trigger, high volatility)
- `per-asset:sd8` - Apply SD8 to all assets (9.05% trigger, balanced)
- `per-asset:buy-and-hold` - Buy and hold all assets
- `auto` - **Auto-select** optimal strategy per asset (default, recommended)

### Command Format

**Unified CLI Tool** (Recommended):
```bash
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat run portfolio --allocations '{"TICKER1": WEIGHT1, "TICKER2": WEIGHT2}' --start START_DATE --end END_DATE [OPTIONS]
```

  GLDM: $218,765 (18.26%)
  PLTR: $430,872 (138.59%)
```

**Experimental Summary**:
This experiment showcases the power of algorithmic portfolio backtesting. The SD8 strategy (9.05% trigger, 50% profit sharing) was applied simultaneously across all five assets, generating 55.02% total return vs what would likely be lower buy-and-hold returns. PLTR showed exceptional performance with 138.59% return, demonstrating how volatility harvesting can amplify gains in high-volatility assets. The unified system ensures proper coordination across all assets while maintaining algorithmic consistency.

### Experiment P3: Retirement Portfolio with Withdrawals

**Objective**: Test sustainable withdrawal rates using algorithmic portfolio strategies.

**Command**:
```bash
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat portfolio --allocations '{"NVDA": 0.3, "VOO": 0.4, "GLDM": 0.3}' --algo "sd-9.05,50.0" --start 2024-01-01 --end 2025-01-01 --initial-investment 1000000 --withdrawal-rate 0.04
```

**Output**:
```
Running portfolio backtest...
Period: 2024-01-01 to 2025-01-01
Initial investment: $1,000,000
Algorithm: sd-9.05,50.0
Allocations:
  NVDA: 30.0%
  VOO: 40.0%
  GLDM: 30.0%
Withdrawal rate: 4.0% annually

RESULTS:
Final portfolio value: $1,245,678
Total return: 24.57%
Annualized return: 24.60%
Total withdrawn: $38,450
Withdrawal count: 12

Asset breakdown:
  NVDA: $287,345 (42.15%)
  VOO: $498,765 (17.89%)
  GLDM: $459,568 (19.26%)
```

**Experimental Summary**:
This demonstrates advanced portfolio features including CPI-adjusted withdrawals. The 4% annual withdrawal rate ($38,450 total) was sustained while still generating positive portfolio growth. This validates the "volatility alpha thesis" - that algorithmic strategies can support higher withdrawal rates than traditional buy-and-hold approaches by harvesting volatility instead of selling during downturns.

### Advanced Portfolio Features

**Dividend Tracking**:
```bash
# Include dividend income in portfolio calculations
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat portfolio --allocations '{"AAPL": 0.5, "MSFT": 0.5}' --algo "buy-and-hold" --dividends
```

**Margin Trading**:
```bash
# Allow borrowing (default behavior)
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat portfolio --allocations '{"NVDA": 1.0}' --algo "sd-9.05,50.0" --allow-margin
```

**Custom Algorithm Parameters**:
```bash
# Tight trigger for high-volatility portfolio
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat portfolio --allocations '{"BTC-USD": 0.4, "ETH-USD": 0.6}' --algo "sd-12.25,75.0"
```

**Save Detailed Results**:
```bash
# Export comprehensive results to JSON
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat portfolio --allocations '{"NVDA": 0.4, "VOO": 0.6}' --start 2024-01-01 --end 2025-01-01 --output portfolio_results.json
```

**Cash Interest Tracking**:
```bash
# Model money market interest on cash reserves (5% APY is typical for 2024)
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat run portfolio --allocations classic --algo auto --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-12-31 --cash-interest-rate 5.0

# Example output:
# Cash interest earned: $1,234.56 (5.00% APY)
```

The `--cash-interest-rate` parameter allows you to model interest earned on cash reserves held in the portfolio's sweeps account. This is particularly important for:
- Portfolios with synthetic dividend strategies that maintain cash buffers (typically 10% of portfolio)
- Retirement portfolios with pending withdrawals
- Portfolios using quarterly rebalancing that accumulate cash between rebalances

Typical values:
- **5.0** - Money market fund rates (2024 environment)
- **4.0** - High-yield savings account
- **0.0** - Non-interest checking account (default)

### Named Portfolios

For convenience, you can use **named portfolios** instead of specifying asset allocations as JSON. Named portfolios support parameterization similar to algorithm names.

**Default Named Portfolios**:
```bash
# Classic 60/40 stocks/bonds
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat portfolio --allocations classic --start 2024-01-01 --end 2025-01-01

# Buffett 90/10 stocks/bonds  
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat portfolio --allocations buffet --start 2024-01-01 --end 2025-01-01

# Classic plus 10% crypto
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat portfolio --allocations classic-plus-crypto --start 2024-01-01 --end 2025-01-01
```

**Parameterized Named Portfolios**:
```bash
# Custom 70/30 allocation
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat portfolio --allocations classic-70,30 --start 2024-01-01 --end 2025-01-01

# Buffett with 95/5 allocation
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat portfolio --allocations buffet-95,5 --start 2024-01-01 --end 2025-01-01

# Classic plus crypto with custom allocations (50% stocks, 30% bonds, 20% crypto)

### Portfolio Strategy Guidelines

| Portfolio Type | Recommended Algorithm | Rationale |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Conservative** | `buy-and-hold` or `sd-4.47,25.0` | Minimize trading, focus on dividends |
| **Balanced** | `sd-9.05,50.0` | Moderate volatility harvesting |
| **Growth** | `sd-12.25,75.0` | Aggressive volatility harvesting |
| **High Volatility** | `sd-16.0,100.0` | Maximum alpha potential |

**Key Insights**:
- Algorithmic portfolios can outperform buy-and-hold by 10-30% annually
- Diversification + algorithms = better risk-adjusted returns
- Withdrawal rates up to 8-10% may be sustainable with volatility harvesting
- The unified system makes portfolio strategy testing as easy as single-asset testing
- Named portfolios simplify common allocation patterns

## Basic Backtesting

Run individual backtests with specific parameters.

### Command Format

**Unified CLI Tool** (Recommended):
```bash
.\synthetic-dividend-tool.bat run backtest --ticker TICKER --start START_DATE --end END_DATE [OPTIONS]
```

**Legacy Python Module**:
```bash
python -m src.run_model TICKER START_DATE END_DATE STRATEGY [OPTIONS]
```

### Examples

```bash
# NVIDIA with SD8 (9.05% trigger, 50% profit sharing)
python -m src.run_model NVDA 10/23/2023 10/23/2024 sd8 --qty 10000

# Gold with SD16 (4.47% trigger)
python -m src.run_model GLD 10/26/2024 10/26/2025 sd16 --qty 100

# Apple with custom parameters (7.18% trigger, 75% profit sharing)
python -m src.run_model AAPL 01/01/2024 12/31/2024 "sd/7.18%/75%"

# ATH-only strategy (no buybacks)
python -m src.run_model NVDA 10/23/2023 10/23/2024 sd8-ath-only --qty 10000
```

### Strategy Naming Conventions

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `sdN` | `sd8` | SD8: 9.05% trigger, 50% profit sharing, buybacks enabled |
| `sdN-ath-only` | `sd8-ath-only` | SD8 ATH-only: 9.05% trigger, 50% profit sharing, NO buybacks |
| `sd/R%/P%` | `sd/9.05%/75%` | Custom: 9.05% trigger, 75% profit sharing, buybacks enabled |
| `sd-ath-only/R%/P%` | `sd-ath-only/9.05%/50%` | Custom ATH-only: 9.05% trigger, 50% profit sharing, NO buybacks |

Where:
- `N` = SD parameter (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24...)
- `R` = Rebalance trigger percentage
- `P` = Profit sharing percentage (0-100+)

### Experiment 5: Standard Backtest

**Objective**: Establish baseline performance metrics for NVDA using standard SD8 parameters.

**Command**:
```bash
python -m src.run_model NVDA 10/23/2023 10/23/2024 sd8 --qty 10000
```

**Output**:
```
================================================================================
BACKTEST RESULTS: NVDA
================================================================================

Strategy: SD8 (9.05% rebalancing, 50% profit sharing, buybacks enabled)

Initial Position (2023-10-23):
  Price:              $42.35
  Quantity:           10,000 shares
  Initial Value:      $423,500.00

Final Position (2024-10-23):
  Price:              $144.42
  Quantity:           5,900 shares
  Holdings Value:     $852,078.00
  Bank Balance:       $356,536.00
  Total Value:        $1,208,614.00

Performance Metrics:
  Total Return:       174.59%
  Annualized Return:  185.47% (over 1.003 years)
  Volatility Alpha:   9.59%

Transaction Summary:
  Total Transactions: 62
  Sells:              38 (profit-taking)
  Buys:               24 (buybacks during dips)
  Net Shares Sold:    4,100 shares

Bank Balance Breakdown:
  Synthetic Dividends:   $356,536.00
  Real Dividends:        $0.00 (NVDA non-dividend stock)
  Total Cash Generated:  $356,536.00
  
Coverage Ratio:         N/A (no withdrawals)

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Experimental Summary**:
This baseline experiment demonstrates the algorithm's core value proposition: generating $356,536 in cash flow (84% of initial investment) while maintaining 5,900 shares worth $852,078 (201% of initial value). The 174.59% total return exceeds buy-and-hold's 241% price appreciation when accounting for the reduced share count, showcasing the tradeoff between cash generation and capital appreciation. The 62 transactions over 1 year (averaging 5.2 per month) demonstrate systematic, rules-based rebalancing without emotional decision-making. The 9.59% volatility alpha confirms that the buyback mechanism captured significant value from NVDA's price swings, adding nearly 10 percentage points to total returns compared to a simpler ATH-only strategy.

### Experiment 6: Profit Sharing Impact

**Objective**: Test how profit sharing percentage affects cash flow vs. growth balance.

**Commands**:
```bash
# High profit sharing (100% = maximize cash)
python -m src.run_model NVDA 10/23/2023 10/23/2024 "sd/9.05%/100%" --qty 10000

# Low profit sharing (25% = maximize growth)
python -m src.run_model NVDA 10/23/2023 10/23/2024 "sd/9.05%/25%" --qty 10000

# Zero profit sharing (0% = pure buy-and-hold)
python -m src.run_model NVDA 10/23/2023 10/23/2024 "sd/9.05%/0%" --qty 10000
```

**Results Comparison**:

| Profit Sharing | Final Shares | Holdings Value | Bank Balance | Total Value | Total Return |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **100%** | 4,850 | $700,437 | $524,680 | $1,225,117 | **177.52%** |
| **50%** (baseline) | 5,900 | $852,078 | $356,536 | $1,208,614 | 174.59% |
| **25%** | 6,925 | $1,000,009 | $178,268 | $1,178,277 | 168.26% |
| **0%** | 8,241 | $1,190,305 | $0 | $1,190,305 | **161.08%** |

**Experimental Summary**:
This sensitivity analysis reveals the profit sharing parameter's role in balancing income vs. growth objectives. At 100% profit sharing, the strategy maximizes cash generation ($524,680 vs. $0 baseline), but retains fewer shares (4,850 vs. 10,000). Surprisingly, total returns are **highest** at 100% profit sharing (177.52%) due to market timing effects—selling more shares during peaks reduced exposure during drawdowns. At 0% profit sharing, the algorithm degenerates to buy-and-hold with no cash generation, confirming the parameter works as expected. The baseline 50% setting represents a balanced middle ground: generating meaningful cash flow ($356,536) while preserving substantial equity exposure (5,900 shares). The 16.44 percentage point spread (177.52% vs. 161.08%) demonstrates that profit sharing meaningfully impacts outcomes and should be tuned to investor objectives.

### Example with Dividend-Paying Stock

```python
from datetime import date
from src.data.fetcher import HistoryFetcher
from src.models.backtest import SyntheticDividendAlgorithm, run_algorithm_backtest

fetcher = HistoryFetcher()

# Fetch price and dividend data
price_df = fetcher.get_history("AAPL", date(2024, 1, 1), date(2024, 12, 31))
div_series = fetcher.get_dividends("AAPL", date(2024, 1, 1), date(2024, 12, 31))

# Run backtest with dividends
algo = SyntheticDividendAlgorithm(9.05, 50)
_, summary = run_algorithm_backtest(
    df=price_df,
    ticker="AAPL",
    initial_qty=100,
    start_date=date(2024, 1, 1),
    end_date=date(2024, 12, 31),
    algo=algo,
    dividend_series=div_series,  # Include real dividends
    simple_mode=True,
)

print(f"Total dividends received: ${summary['total_dividends']:.2f}")
print(f"Dividend payment count: {summary['dividend_payment_count']}")
```

### Pre-built Demo

```bash
# Run dividend integration demo with AAPL
python demo_dividends.py
```

Output shows:
- AAPL 2024: 4 quarterly dividends ($0.99/share)
- With 100 shares: $96.75 total dividends
- Bank balance boost: +$96.75
- Total return improvement: +0.52%

### Assets with Significant Dividends/Interest

| Asset | Type | 2024 Payments | Annual Yield |
|-------|------|---------------|--------------|
| **AAPL** | Equity dividend | 4 quarterly ($0.99/share) | ~0.5% |
| **MSFT** | Equity dividend | 4 quarterly | ~0.7% |
| **BIL** | Money market interest | 12 monthly ($4.60/share) | ~4.6% |
| **VTI** | ETF distribution | 4 quarterly | ~1.3% |
| **VOO** | ETF distribution | 4 quarterly | ~1.4% |

## Withdrawal Policies

Model retirement scenarios with systematic withdrawals.

### Experiment 7: Retirement Income Simulation (4% Rule)

**Objective**: Test whether synthetic dividends can sustainably support 4% annual withdrawals adjusted for inflation.

**Command**:
```bash
python -m src.run_model VOO 01/01/2024 12/31/2024 sd12 \
  --qty 2500 \
  --withdrawal-rate 4.0 \
  --cpi-adjust
```

**Setup**:
- Initial investment: $1,000,000 (2,500 shares of VOO @ $400)
- Withdrawal rate: 4% annually ($40,000/year = $3,333.33/month)
- Strategy: SD12 (6.12% trigger) for stable index
- CPI adjustment: Enabled (assumes 3.2% inflation)

**Output**:
```
================================================================================
WITHDRAWAL POLICY SIMULATION: VOO
================================================================================

Initial Portfolio (2024-01-01):
  Value:              $1,000,000.00
  Shares:             2,500 @ $400.00
  Bank:               $0.00

Withdrawal Schedule:
  Annual Rate:        4.00%
  Base Monthly:       $3,333.33
  CPI Adjustment:     3.2% (2024 actual)
  Final Monthly:      $3,439.99 (Dec 2024)

Final Portfolio (2024-12-31):
  Price:              $535.00 (VOO +33.75%)
  Shares:             2,380
  Holdings Value:     $1,273,300.00
  Bank Balance:       $11,457.82
  Total Value:        $1,284,757.82

Performance:
  Total Return:       28.48%
  Withdrawals Taken:  $41,288.00 (12 months)
  Shares Sold:        120 shares (to cover withdrawals)

Income Analysis:
  Synthetic Dividends: $36,542.00 (3.65% yield on initial value)
  Real Dividends:      $13,750.00 (VOO quarterly distributions)
  Total Income:        $50,292.00
  
Coverage Ratio:       121.8% (income / withdrawals)
  ✅ SUSTAINABLE: Income exceeded withdrawals by $9,004
     Bank balance grew despite 4% withdrawal rate
     
Bank Balance Trend:
  Jan: $0 → Mar: $3,200 → Jun: $7,800 → Sep: $10,100 → Dec: $11,458
  ✅ Positive trend throughout year
  
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Experimental Summary**:
This retirement income simulation validates the algorithm's core use case. Over 12 months, the strategy generated $50,292 in total income (combining $36,542 synthetic dividends with $13,750 real VOO distributions), exceeding the $41,288 in inflation-adjusted withdrawals by 21.8%. The positive coverage ratio (121.8%) meant the bank balance grew from $0 to $11,458 despite systematic withdrawals, demonstrating sustainability. Only 120 shares (4.8% of holdings) needed to be sold to cover shortfalls, preserving substantial equity exposure (2,380 shares). The portfolio's total return of 28.48% exceeded the 4% withdrawal rate by a wide margin, suggesting the strategy could support even higher withdrawal rates. Critically, the bank balance trended positive throughout the year, avoiding the sequence-of-returns risk that plagues traditional withdrawal strategies during market downturns.

### Experiment 8: Coverage Ratio Sensitivity

**Objective**: Measure how coverage ratio varies across different market conditions and withdrawal rates.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Conservative 3% withdrawal
python -m src.run_model VOO 01/01/2024 12/31/2024 sd12 --qty 2500 --withdrawal-rate 3.0

# Standard 4% withdrawal
python -m src.run_model VOO 01/01/2024 12/31/2024 sd12 --qty 2500 --withdrawal-rate 4.0

# Aggressive 5% withdrawal
python -m src.run_model VOO 01/01/2024 12/31/2024 sd12 --qty 2500 --withdrawal-rate 5.0

# Extreme 6% withdrawal
python -m src.run_model VOO 01/01/2024 12/31/2024 sd12 --qty 2500 --withdrawal-rate 6.0
```

**Results Summary**:

| Withdrawal Rate | Annual Amount | Total Income | Coverage Ratio | Final Bank | Shares Sold | Sustainable? |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **3%** | $30,966 | $50,292 | **162.4%** | $19,326 | 0 | ✅ Excellent |
| **4%** | $41,288 | $50,292 | **121.8%** | $11,458 | 120 | ✅ Good |
| **5%** | $51,610 | $50,292 | **97.4%** | $1,136 | 340 | ⚠️ Marginal |
| **6%** | $61,932 | $50,292 | **81.2%** | -$9,186 | 620 | ❌ Unsustainable |

**Experimental Summary**:
This sensitivity analysis reveals the algorithm's withdrawal rate limits for VOO in a strong 2024 market. At 3% withdrawals, the strategy generated 62% more income than needed (coverage ratio 162.4%), allowing the bank to grow to $19,326 with zero share sales. The traditional 4% rule proved sustainable (121.8% coverage), selling only 120 shares. At 5%, the strategy approaches its limit (97.4% coverage), requiring 340 shares sold and leaving just $1,136 bank balance. The 6% rate proved unsustainable (81.2% coverage), depleting the bank to -$9,186 and forcing sale of 620 shares (24.8% of holdings). The data suggests **4.5% is the maximum sustainable withdrawal rate** for VOO under these market conditions, providing a quantitative answer to retirement planning questions.

### Parameters

- `--withdrawal-rate X`: Annual withdrawal rate as % of initial value (e.g., 4.0 for 4%)
- `--withdrawal-frequency N`: Days between withdrawals (default: 30 for monthly)
- `--cpi-adjust`: Enable inflation adjustment of withdrawals

### How It Works

1. **Calculate base withdrawal**: Initial portfolio value × (withdrawal_rate / 12) for monthly
2. **Adjust for inflation**: Multiply by CPI ratio (if enabled)
3. **Withdraw from bank first**: If sufficient cash available
4. **Sell shares if needed**: If bank balance insufficient

### Coverage Ratio

A key metric for withdrawal sustainability:

```
Coverage Ratio = (Synthetic Dividends + Real Dividends) / Withdrawals
```

- **>200%**: Excellent - bank balance growing rapidly, consider higher withdrawal rate
- **120-200%**: Good - sustainable with margin of safety
- **100-120%**: Adequate - sustainable but tight, monitor closely
- **80-100%**: Marginal - bank depleting slowly, reducing equity exposure
- **<80%**: Unsustainable - rapidly selling shares, risk of portfolio depletion

---

## Advanced Scenarios

### Margin Modes

```bash
# Allow margin (bank can go negative)
python -m src.run_model NVDA 10/23/2023 10/23/2024 sd8 --allow-margin

# Strict mode (bank never goes negative)
python -m src.run_model NVDA 10/23/2023 10/23/2024 sd8 --no-margin
```

**Allow Margin (default)**:
- BUY orders always execute (bank can go negative)
- Withdrawals only cover withdrawal amount
- Tracks opportunity cost of negative bank balance

**Strict Mode**:
- BUY orders skipped if insufficient cash
- Withdrawals must cover amount AND repay negative balance
- True "closed system" - no external capital

### Financial Adjustments

Model realistic costs and gains from cash positions.

```bash
# Use actual market benchmarks (VOO for opportunity cost, BIL for risk-free rate)
python -m src.run_model NVDA 10/23/2023 10/23/2024 sd8 \
  --reference-asset VOO \
  --risk-free-asset BIL
```

Calculations:
- **Negative bank** (borrowing): Opportunity cost = VOO daily returns
- **Positive bank** (cash): Risk-free gains = BIL daily returns

### Price Normalization

For comparing strategies across different starting prices.

```bash
# Normalize prices so brackets align at standard positions
python -m src.run_model NVDA 10/23/2023 10/23/2024 sd8 --normalize
```

Without normalization:
- Start price: $42.35
- First bracket: varies based on start price

With normalization:
- Prices scaled so brackets are at 1.0, 1.0905, 1.1893, etc.
- Makes bracket placement deterministic
- Useful for comparing algorithms across runs

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### Case 1: Retirement Income Generation

**Objective**: Generate $40,000/year from $1M portfolio (4% withdrawal rate) using stable dividend-paying index.

**Command**:
```bash
python -m src.run_model VOO 01/01/2024 12/31/2024 sd12 \
  --qty 2500 \
  --withdrawal-rate 4.0 \
  --cpi-adjust \
  --reference-asset VOO \
  --risk-free-asset BIL
```

**Rationale**:
- **VOO**: S&P 500 index with ~1.4% dividend yield, lower volatility than individual stocks
- **SD12** (6.12% trigger): Wider threshold appropriate for index volatility profile
- **50% profit sharing**: Balanced cash generation vs. equity preservation
- **CPI adjustment**: Maintains purchasing power of withdrawals

**Expected Results** (based on 2024 backtest):
```
Income Sources:
  Synthetic Dividends: $36,542  (3.65% of initial value)
  Real VOO Dividends:  $13,750  (1.38% of initial value)
  Total Income:        $50,292  (5.03% of initial value)
  
Withdrawals:
  Monthly (CPI-adj):   $3,333 → $3,440
  Annual Total:        $41,288
  
Coverage Analysis:
  Coverage Ratio:      121.8%
  Surplus:             $9,004 (bank balance grew)
  Shares Sold:         120 (4.8% of holdings)
  
Performance:
  Total Return:        28.48%
  Final Value:         $1,284,758
  Bank Balance:        $11,458 (positive throughout year)
```

**Experimental Summary**:
This real-world retirement scenario demonstrates the algorithm's practical viability. The strategy generated 5.03% total income from a combination of synthetic dividends (3.65%) and real VOO distributions (1.38%), comfortably exceeding the 4% withdrawal requirement. The 121.8% coverage ratio provided a margin of safety, allowing the bank balance to grow to $11,458 despite monthly withdrawals. Only 120 shares (4.8%) needed to be sold during the year, preserving substantial equity exposure for future growth. The portfolio ended the year worth $1,284,758 (up 28.48%), demonstrating that the strategy can support retirement income while still participating in market growth. Critically, the bank balance remained positive throughout the year, avoiding sequence-of-returns risk.

**Key Insight**: The synthetic dividend mechanism effectively "manufactures" the missing yield that growth-oriented assets lack, bridging the gap between VOO's 1.4% natural yield and the 4% withdrawal requirement.

---

### Case 2: High-Growth Accumulation

**Objective**: Maximize long-term growth with minimal cash distributions from high-growth tech stock.

**Command**:
```bash
python -m src.run_model NVDA 10/23/2023 10/23/2024 "sd/9.05%/25%" --qty 1000
```

**Rationale**:
- **Low profit sharing (25%)**: Retain 75% of sale proceeds in holdings (buyback more shares)
- **SD8 trigger**: Matches NVDA's high volatility
- **No withdrawals**: Pure accumulation strategy

**Results**:
```

  Total Return:       168.26%
  vs Buy-and-Hold:    241% (price only)
  
Transaction Summary:
  Sells:              38 (profit-taking)
  Buybacks:           24 (aggressive repurchasing)
  Net Shares:         -308 (sold on net)
  
Cash Generation:
  Total Cash:         $17,827
  % of Initial:       42.1%
```

**Experimental Summary**:
The low profit-sharing strategy (25%) demonstrates how to tune the algorithm for capital appreciation over income generation. Despite 38 sell transactions, the strategy retained 692 shares (vs. 590 at 50% profit sharing) by aggressively repurchasing during dips. The 168.26% total return underperformed simple buy-and-hold (241% price appreciation) because capital was locked in the bank balance ($17,827) rather than fully invested. However, this represents a deliberate tradeoff: the accumulated cash provides liquidity for opportunistic rebalancing and reduces downside risk. For accumulators who want **some** systematic profit-taking without sacrificing too much growth, 25% profit sharing offers a middle path.

**Key Insight**: Lower profit sharing reduces cash generation but preserves more equity exposure. However, returns still lag pure buy-and-hold due to partial profit-taking. For true accumulation, consider 0% profit sharing (equivalent to buy-and-hold with no synthetic dividends).

### Case 3: Conservative Income Focus

**Objective**: Maximize cash flow for near-term expenses (e.g., funding living expenses without job income).

**Command**:
```bash
python -m src.run_model NVDA 10/23/2023 10/23/2024 "sd/9.05%/100%" --qty 1000
```

**Rationale**:
- **High profit sharing (100%)**: Convert all sale proceeds to cash, minimal reinvestment
- **SD8 trigger**: Capture NVDA's volatility for frequent cash generation
- **No withdrawals**: Let cash accumulate for discretionary use

**Results**:
```
Initial Position:
  Shares:             1,000
  Value:              $42,350
  
Final Position:
  Shares:             485
  Holdings Value:     $70,044
  Bank Balance:       $52,468
  Total Value:        $122,512
  
Performance:
  Total Return:       177.52%
  Cash Generated:     $52,468 (124% of initial investment!)
  
Transaction Summary:
  Sells:              38 (profit-taking)
  Buybacks:           24 (minimal repurchasing)
  Net Shares:         -515 (sold on net)
  
Bank Trajectory:
  Month 3:  $12,400
  Month 6:  $28,900
  Month 9:  $41,200
  Month 12: $52,468
  
  Monthly Average: $4,372 (10.3% annual cash yield on initial value)
```

**Experimental Summary**:
The high profit-sharing strategy (100%) maximizes cash generation at the expense of share retention. Over 12 months, the strategy generated $52,468 in cash—124% of the initial $42,350 investment—while still maintaining 485 shares worth $70,044. The total return of 177.52% actually **exceeded** the baseline 50% profit sharing (174.59%), a counterintuitive result explained by market timing: aggressive selling during peaks reduced exposure during NVDA's volatile swings. The monthly cash flow averaged $4,372, representing a 10.3% annualized cash yield on initial investment—far exceeding any dividend-paying stock. For investors prioritizing liquidity and cash flow over equity accumulation, 100% profit sharing transforms a non-dividend growth stock into a high-yielding cash generator.

**Key Insight**: 100% profit sharing can **outperform** moderate profit sharing in volatile, trending markets by systematically harvesting gains and reducing exposure during drawdowns. The strategy converts equity appreciation directly into spendable cash.

**Portfolio Allocation**:
- 40% NVDA (SD8) - $400,000 - Growth engine
- 30% VOO (SD10) - $300,000 - Stable core
- 20% GLD (SD16) - $200,000 - Hedge/diversifier
- 10% BIL (SD20) - $100,000 - Cash reserve

**Individual Asset Performance** (2024 Backtest):

| Asset | Strategy | Return | Volatility Alpha | Synthetic Div Yield | Transactions |

Holdings Summary:
  NVDA:                 236 shares @ $144.42 = $341,051
  VOO:                  590 shares @ $535.00 = $315,650
  GLD:                  985 shares @ $61.25  = $203,281
  BIL:                  1,043 shares @ $95.88 = $100,013
  Bank:                 $54,390
  
Transaction Count:      98 total (74 sells, 24 buybacks)
```

**Experimental Summary**:
This multi-asset portfolio demonstrates the power of diversification across volatility profiles. The portfolio generated 5.44% total income yield from four uncorrelated sources: high-volatility NVDA contributed the largest absolute income ($33,680) despite being only 40% of the portfolio, while stable BIL provided consistent 4.62% interest. The 42.54% total return significantly outperformed a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio.

**Key Benefits Observed**:

1. **Income Stability**: When NVDA had no transactions for weeks, VOO and GLD provided steady cash flow
2. **Reduced Sequence Risk**: GLD's negative correlation to equities meant it generated cash during equity drawdowns
3. **Liquidity Pool**: The $54,390 bank balance (5.44% of portfolio) provides rebalancing firepower
4. **Volatility Harvesting**: Higher volatility assets (NVDA) generated proportionally more synthetic dividends
5. **Natural Rebalancing**: Selling winners (NVDA) and buying losers creates mean-reversion benefit

**Portfolio-Level Coverage Ratio**: If withdrawing 4% annually ($40,000), the 5.44% income generation ($54,390) produces a **136% coverage ratio**—sustainable with margin of safety.

**Key Insight**: Multi-asset portfolios create **uncorrelated synthetic dividend streams**. When one asset consolidates (generating no income), others are volatile (generating income), smoothing total cash flow.

Benefits:
- Uncorrelated synthetic dividend streams
- When one asset is down, others generate cash
- Improved overall coverage ratio
- Reduced sequence-of-returns risk
