## 🎯 Core Concepts (30-second refresh)

**Volatility Alpha**: `algorithm_return - buy_and_hold_return`  
**Rebalance Trigger**: sd8 = 9.05% (8th root of 2)  
**Profit Sharing**: 50% = balanced (sell half of profit, keep half)  
**Bracket Position**: 1.0 × (1.0905)^n for sd8

## 🔧 Key Parameters

### Backtest Engine
```python
run_algorithm_backtest(
    df=price_data,                  # OHLC DataFrame
    ticker="NVDA",                  # Symbol
    initial_qty=1000,               # Shares to start
    start_date=date(2020, 1, 1),    # Begin
    end_date=date(2024, 1, 1),      # End
    algo=SyntheticDividendAlgorithm(
        rebalance_size_pct=9.05,    # sd8 trigger
        profit_sharing_pct=50.0,    # 50% balanced
        buyback_enabled=True,       # Full vs ATH-only
    ),
    # Optional enhancements
    normalize_prices=False,          # Deterministic brackets
    withdrawal_rate_pct=0.0,         # 4% = retirement
    withdrawal_frequency_days=30,    # Monthly
    simple_mode=False,               # Clean testing
)
```

### Order Calculator
```bash
python -m src.tools.order_calculator \
    --ticker NVDA \
    --holdings 1000 \
    --last-price 120.50 \
    --current-price 125.30 \
    --sdn 8 \
    --profit 50
```

## 📊 Return Metrics (What to Look At)

**Primary Metrics** (these matter most):
- `total_return` - Overall gain/loss
- `volatility_alpha` - Excess return vs buy-and-hold
- `annualized` - Yearly equivalent return

**Secondary Metrics** (context):
- `holdings` - Final share count
- `bank` - Cash position
- `opportunity_cost` - Borrowing cost
- `risk_free_gains` - Cash interest

**Withdrawal Metrics**:
- `total_withdrawn` - Total cash withdrawn
- `shares_sold_for_withdrawals` - Forced selling count

---

## 🧪 Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_price_normalization.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run single test
pytest tests/test_withdrawal_policy.py::test_withdrawal_from_bank_balance -v
```

| Why does this work? | INVESTING_THEORY.md |
| What is volatility alpha? | VOLATILITY_ALPHA_THESIS.md |
| How do we measure returns? | RETURN_METRICS_ANALYSIS.md |
| Why opportunity cost? | INITIAL_CAPITAL_THEORY.md |
| How do brackets work? | PRICE_NORMALIZATION.md |
| How do withdrawals work? | WITHDRAWAL_POLICY.md |
| What's the vision? | PORTFOLIO_VISION.md |

## 🐛 Debugging Checklist

**If tests fail**:
1. Read error message carefully
2. Check if theory still matches implementation
3. Look at last passing commit
4. Run single failing test with `-v -s`
5. Add debug prints to isolate issue

**If results seem wrong**:
1. Check: Are you using simple_mode for testing?
2. Check: Is normalize_prices affecting comparison?
3. Check: Are withdrawals enabled unintentionally?
4. Check: Is opportunity cost being double-counted?

**If behavior changed**:
1. Did theory document update?
2. Did test assertions change?
3. Did new parameter get added?
4. Check git diff for recent changes

## 🎨 Code Style Guide

**Variable Naming**:
- `rebalance_size` = decimal (0.0905)
- `rebalance_size_pct` = percentage (9.05)
- `_pct` suffix = percentage value
- `_df` suffix = DataFrame
- `_total` suffix = cumulative sum

**Function Naming**:
- `calculate_*` = pure function, no side effects
- `run_*` = executes process, returns results
- `format_*` = transforms data for display

**Test Naming**:
- `test_<behavior>_<scenario>` format
- Descriptive names (not test_001)
- Group related tests in classes

## 🎓 Key Formulas (Quick Reference)

**Rebalance Trigger**:
```
trigger = (2^(1/N) - 1) × 100
sd4  = 18.92%
sd6  = 12.25%
sd8  =  9.05%
sd16 =  4.43%
```

**Buy/Sell Prices**:
```
buy_price = last_price / (1 + trigger)
sell_price = last_price × (1 + trigger)
```

**Bracket Number**:
```
n = log(price) / log(1 + trigger)
normalized_price = 1.0 × (1 + trigger)^round(n)
```

**Volatility Alpha**:
```
alpha = (final_value_algo - start_value) / start_value
      - (final_value_buyhold - start_value) / start_value
```

## 💡 Design Principles (Remember These)

1. **Orthogonality**: Features should be independent (withdrawals ≠ strategy)
2. **Test Behavior**: Test economic outcomes, not implementation details
3. **Theory First**: Document conceptual model before coding
4. **Fail Fast**: Clear error messages at validation time
5. **Empirical**: Experiments validate theory, not the reverse

## ⚡ Performance Notes

**Typical Backtest**: 1-5 seconds for 4 years daily data  
**Test Suite**: ~5 seconds for all 39 tests  
**Memory**: Minimal (<100MB for typical backtest)  
**Bottleneck**: DataFrame operations (already optimized)

**Not optimized for**: Real-time trading, high-frequency data
