## Exposure Concentration Risk

The underperformance of SD8 compared to buy-and-hold (even with large withdrawal rates)
is partially justified by the reduction in exposure risk.

For single-asset portfolios, we can define "quarterly rebalancing" as rebalancing DOWN to
the original investment/exposure level to prevent exposure concentration. This would be:
- Systematic profit-taking to maintain constant dollar exposure
- Prevents "all eggs in one basket" concentration as asset appreciates
- Provides natural risk management without requiring diversification

This is analogous to multi-asset portfolio rebalancing, but applied to position sizing
rather than asset allocation.
